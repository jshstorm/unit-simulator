# Web-based GUI Viewer Prototype

This document outlines a prototype implementation of a web-based GUI viewer for the simulation. This serves as a foundation for further enhancements.

## Features

1. **Central Frame:**
   - Renders the current simulation frame data, providing a visual overview of the ongoing simulation.

2. **Unit State Viewer:**
   - Displays basic information: health, position, and status for each unit in the simulation.

3. **Unit Selection Feature:**
   - Highlights selected units, making it easier for users to identify and manage unit statuses during the simulation.

4. **Input Commands:**
   - Allows users to issue commands for units to move or interact with the simulation environment.

## Further Developments
This prototype lays the groundwork for future enhancements and features that can be integrated into the GUI viewer to improve user interaction and simulation management.
